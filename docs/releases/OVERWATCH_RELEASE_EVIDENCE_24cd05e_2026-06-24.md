## Validation Commands

- `python -m unittest discover -s tests`: PASS, 997 tests

## Deployment Contract
- Streamlit in Snowflake entrypoint: PASS via `tests.test_deployment_contract`
- Manifest: PASS via `tests.test_deployment_contract`
- Warehouse: PASS via `tests.test_deployment_contract`
- Execute-as boundary: PASS via `tests.test_deployment_contract`
- Result: PASS, deployment contract validated locally for `24cd05e2e27ced74b29718ba85ce6112b2227cf7`

## Mart Setup
- Setup script used: `snowflake/OVERWATCH_MART_SETUP.sql`
- Target account/environment: `LOKAXGM-WU94316`, `DBA_MAINT_DB.OVERWATCH`
- Core facts verified: PASS in `docs/OVERWATCH_SNOWFLAKE_REGRESSION_RESULTS.md`
- Mart load status: PASS in the latest credentialed live regression evidence
- Notes: Mart setup was not rerun in this pass because no mart object drop, rename, disable, rewrite, or SQL semantic change was made.

## Browser Sanity
- Executive Landing: PASS in section smoke run `PERF_TEST_SECTION_SMOKE_RELEASE_24cd05e`
- DBA Control Room: PASS in section smoke run `PERF_TEST_SECTION_SMOKE_RELEASE_24cd05e`
- Alert Center: PASS in section smoke run `PERF_TEST_SECTION_SMOKE_RELEASE_24cd05e`
- Cost & Contract: PASS in section smoke run `PERF_TEST_SECTION_SMOKE_RELEASE_24cd05e`
- Workload Operations: PASS in section smoke run `PERF_TEST_SECTION_SMOKE_RELEASE_24cd05e`
- Security Monitoring: PASS in section smoke run `PERF_TEST_SECTION_SMOKE_RELEASE_24cd05e`
- Legacy/deep-link workflow checks: covered by route registry, navigation integrity, facade no-creep, and full unit discovery tests; no separate manual deep-link browser pass was run because route compatibility is locked by automated contracts.

## Performance Smoke
- `perf_tests/README.md` threshold review: PASS, section smoke completed against `http://localhost:8501/`
- Section smoke result: PASS, `PERF_TEST_SECTION_SMOKE_RELEASE_24cd05e`
- HTTP/live browser p95: `253.32 ms`
- Failed dashboard queries: `0` section smoke errors recorded
- Readiness score: `100/100`

## 12 Power User Performance
- Run ID: `PERF_12_POWER_USERS_RELEASE`
- Users: `12`
- Iterations: `3`
- p95: `17233.75 ms`
- p99: `35243.59 ms`
- errors: `0`
- readiness: `57/100`
- slowest section: `App Shell`
- slowest action: `initial_load`
- skipped buttons: `36`, all `Alert Center -> Load Issue Inbox`
- live report path: `perf_tests/results/PERF_12_POWER_USERS_RELEASE_live_concurrent.json`
- expert review path: `perf_tests/results/PERF_12_POWER_USERS_RELEASE_expert_review.md`
- result: FAIL, because p95 exceeded the 10000 ms 12-power-user release threshold even though browser-step errors were zero.

## Guarded Operations
- Action queue review-only smoke: PASS via unit contracts covering review-only action queue behavior and full unit discovery
- Typed confirmation smoke: PASS via guarded Task Management/Admin contracts and full unit discovery
- `admin_button_disabled()` unauthorized-user smoke: PASS via production readiness contract, admin control tests, guarded Task Management contracts, and full unit discovery
- Notes: No state-changing admin operation was executed as part of this release evidence pass.

## Live Snowflake Regression
- Run status: PASS from latest credentialed run; no new live Snowflake regression was run for `24cd05e`.
- Credentials/auth available: available for the recorded run in `docs/OVERWATCH_SNOWFLAKE_REGRESSION_RESULTS.md`
- Result: PASS from prior credentialed evidence, see `docs/OVERWATCH_SNOWFLAKE_REGRESSION_RESULTS.md`
- Status: `PASS`
- Run ID: `SNOWFLAKE_REGRESSION_LIVE_PASS`
- Role: `SNOW_ACCOUNTADMINS`
- Warehouse: `COMPUTE_WH`
- Database/schema: `DBA_MAINT_DB.OVERWATCH`
- If not run, reason: New live regression not run for `24cd05e` because the latest credentialed PASS evidence was already recorded; local validation, full unit regression, and section smoke were rerun for this release candidate.

## Secrets Check
- Git diff/logs/screenshots/release notes checked: PASS, tracked release files contain no literal Snowflake password, private key, or token.
- Result: PASS, `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and generated performance results remain ignored.

## Rollback / Reset
- Rollback reference: `STREAMLIT_CLOUD_DEPLOY.md`
- `snowflake/OVERWATCH_MART_DROP.sql` reset posture acknowledged: acknowledged as reset/rollback only, not a rationalization or release step
- Notes: No mart object was dropped, renamed, disabled, or rewritten in this pass.

## Deferred Items
- Item: New live Snowflake regression run for `24cd05e`
- Reason: Not rerun because existing credentialed PASS evidence is linked and local validation plus section smoke were rerun for this release candidate.
- Owner: release operator
- Follow-up: rerun `perf_tests/full_app_snowflake_regression.py` only when a fresh credentialed release gate is required.
- Item: 12 heavy power user benchmark for `24cd05e`
- Reason: Failed because live browser p95 was `17233.75 ms` against the `10000 ms` threshold, readiness was `57/100`, and 36 `Alert Center -> Load Issue Inbox` actions were skipped because the button was not visible in the default Alert Center view.
- Owner: release operator
- Follow-up: tune App Shell first-load behavior, DBA Control Room navigation, and Alert Center default load-button visibility; rerun `python perf_tests/run_12_power_users.py --url http://localhost:8501/ --run-id PERF_12_POWER_USERS_RELEASE --output-dir perf_tests/results` and regenerate the expert review.
